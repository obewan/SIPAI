# SIPAI

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" _- Leonardo da Vinci (attributed)_

A Simple Image Processing Artificial Intelligence, by [Dams](https://dams-labs.net/).

SIPAI is a neural network that builds upon my previous SMLP project.
Its initial focus is on image enhancement, with plans for future releases to incorporate additional features such as image anomaly detection and more.

```
This project is currently in study phase.
Development will start soon.
