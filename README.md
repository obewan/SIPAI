# SIPAI

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" _- Leonardo da Vinci (attributed)_

A Simple Image Processing Artificial Intelligence, by [Dams](https://dams-labs.net/).

SIPAI is a neural network that builds upon my previous [SMLP](https://github.com/obewan/SMLP) project.
Its initial focus is on image enhancement, with plans for future releases to incorporate additional features such as image anomaly detection and more.

It uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, with a modification that incorporates elements of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to handle spatial information.

Requirements for compiling the source code:

- A C++20 compiler (like the GNU C++ `g++-12` on Debian)
- The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/get-started/) library
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
